Build ===========================================

$ make all

Install =========================================

$ make install DESTDIR="$PWD/target"

This will create $PWD/target. Note that the folder layout is subject to change.

!!!!!!!!!!
DO NOT SET DESTDIR TO "/" NOR "/usr", it WILL overwrite system libraries.
Use a private directory for now!
For example, "/usr/lib/preenv" or "/opt/preenv"
!!!!!!!!!!

DESTDIR must be an absolute path.

Running =========================================
