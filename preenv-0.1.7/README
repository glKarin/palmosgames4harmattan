Welcome =========================================

This is preenv, a set of stub libraries and patches to third party libraries
that should make running WebOS native plugins (mostly games) on the N900 easier.

Running =========================================

Unpack the binaries tarball somewhere (requires a filesystem with POSIX
semantics).

cd into the directory that contains env.sh.

On your sh-like shell, run:
$ . ./env.sh

Now, change into the directory where your Pre binary is stored and try to run
it.
